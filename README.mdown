iYAPC
=====

iYAPC is an iPhone application aimed at helping to a) promote YAPC and other Perl-related workshops, b) help attendees manage their conference
schedules, c) help people find their way around, d) find out more about conferences and collaborate with other attendees.

It is currently under active development, and is still very Alpha. But the code is Open Source, and the goal is to contribute this to the greater Perl
Community.
